Samsung Health Stack is an open-source project in the form of a tech stack that provides end-to-end solutions for collecting and analyzing data from wearable devices. Applications include medical research studies, clinician services, or whatever your imagination envisions.

As an open-source project, you are invited to contribute those visions to grow the project. You can contribute at any time.
