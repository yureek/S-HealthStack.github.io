The API Documentation of the product, Documentation version v0.9 (beta), is structured into several sections:

1. **Study Management:** This section contains guides for creating a study and managing members. Each guide is accessible via a unique URL and available on the web.

2. **Content Creation:** Here, you can find guides on creating a survey, previewing a survey, and scheduling and publishing a survey. Each guide has a dedicated URL and is available on the web.

3. **Study Execution:** This part includes guides on onboarding participants and collecting data. Each topic has a separate URL and is available on the web.

4. **Results Analysis:** This section provides guides on viewing graphs and charts, running queries, viewing individual results, and exporting data for external analysis. Each guide is accessible via a unique URL and available on the web.

5. **All API Endpoints:** This is a comprehensive section that provides an overview and specific information about different API endpoints, including the Account Service API Endpoints, Study API Endpoints, and Data Query Service API Endpoints. Each topic has a dedicated URL and can be accessed on the web.

The API endpoints mentioned can be used in place of the portal user interface for sending and receiving information, thereby providing a programmatic way to interact with the system. This makes the API documentation a valuable resource for developers and software engineers who are integrating with or building upon this platform.
